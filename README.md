# Final Grade Calculator
Sometimes, it can be reassuring to know that a low exam grade can still mean you pass a class with a B, or even an A, or well... just pass the class.

Other times, you may want to know what grade you'll need on an exam to get an A in a class or, well... just pass the class.

Made by a college student curious to see what his lowest bar to get a B in the ~~nightmare~~ very fun super amazing class!!!!! known as MATH242 (calculus 2) this short script intakes one or more known grades (and their weights), as well as the weight of an unknown grade and the user's target final grade, to determine what grade on the unknown assignment is necessary to reach that target grade... if it is even possible to reach it. Other statistics are provided, such as the maximum/minimum possible final grades based on the unknown grade:

A graph visualizing this is also saved (in *.png format) if the user so wishes. See below for an example:
