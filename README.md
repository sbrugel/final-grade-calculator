# Final Grade Calculator
Sometimes, it can be reassuring to know that a low exam grade can still mean you pass a class with a B, or even an A, or well... just pass the class.

Other times, you may want to know what grade you'll need on an exam to get an A in a class or, well... just pass the class.
